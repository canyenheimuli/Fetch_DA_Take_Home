# Senior Data Analyst Take Home Assessment

This repo contains some code and analysis I wrote for a take home assessment for a role at Fetch.

IMPORTANT: The code references a "PRODUCTS_TAKEHOME.csv" file which I wanted to upload to the repo for reproducibility but which is too big in its raw format so I uploaded it in a compressed format. The code in the Jupyter Notebook file does not accommodate the compressed file: only the raw file.
