I infer that it is the primary key both since it is referred to as an \"ID\" which keys typically are, and because it is a field that has a relationship with another table so it would likely need to be a key to prevent information loss on joins. The total number of missing \"Birth Date\" values is high but not significantly high. Still about 96% of users have a birthday, and about 95% still have \"State\" and \"Gender\" data.\n",

In a table with 100,000 records, only about 70% have language information. Whether or not this is acceptable has to do with marketing as well as data pipelines. It might be assumed that those users can speak and read English, but if they do not, and increasing that sub-group's revenue or traffic is only a matter of updating their language information, it could be *well worth the investment to improve data collection and recording so that more accurate language data is collected for these users*. One potential reason for the missing data of all kinds could be that the user information is *derived from personal identification cards/documents* which may or may not be state-issued, may or may not have gender information, and may or may not be written in a recognizeable language."

So while the distribution of language data roughly tracks with the Census (making a simplifying assumption that all who have their language set to \"English\" are white), it is highly unlikely that all respondents who have missing language data don't read or speak any English.

    "Nearly all products have at least one category and it's reasonable that most products would have both multiple and only 2 at most. The proportion of records missing the 3rd and 4th categories is not a concern to me. About 1 in 4 records are missing both the \"Manufacturer\" and \"Brand\" fields. My guess is that this data is missing for so-called \"generic\" products that are manufactured by retailers themselves and have no brand, or in any case that the missing-ness of this data is intentional and not a data collection issue. As with missing \"Birth Dates\", no common imputation strategy makes sense so I won't use any.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another cause for concern is that there is no field that clearly communicates the product's *name* or *what the product is* -- at least not in one field or a combination of fields that is eminently obvious. For some records (looking at the selected rows above), the nature of the product is mostly communicated across all category fields put together, but this is not always the case. Additional information can be gleaned from the \"Manufacturer\" and \"Brand\" fields where they are present, but these likewise do not definitively communicate the product's name or product type. This will make reporting to company stakeholders very cumbersome as while analysis will be aggregated by the \"Barcode\" field, showing the barcodes alone does not fully communicate the most actionable business insights. Showing all product categories, manufacturing, and brand information can suffice, and will have to in this assessment, but is intractable for quickly and succinctly reporting key findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest cause for concern, however, is that the **\"Barcode\" field is missing for a few thousand records**. Since this is likely the primary key of this table, these records can't be treated as meaningful in any analysis, and they technically should not exist anyway in an internally consistent database mangement system (DBMS). With regard to analysis in this assessment, I will make the simplifying assumption that **these records are faulty and will delete them before conducting analysis**. "

    "This is a serious problem. Not only are there duplicate values for this field, but from this limited view of the data, the duplicates are different in ways that do not denote one single likely cause, nor a single solution. Many records are duplicates with regard to every field in the table, and it can be assumed the duplicate rows for these records were eronneously recorded twice. These duplicates will be easy enough to deal with. But other duplicate records say both a company in the \"Brand\" field and the text \"Brand not known\". Still other duplicates contain two different brands which are not the same with no way to tell between them which is correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "While this is not an ideal solution, I will implement a working approach where I **remove duplicate rows that are the same with respect to all fields including \"Manufacturer\" and \"Brand\"**, and also **remove rows that have conflicting values for other fields and set any and all conflicting fields to \"NA\"**. This is an approach that I believe will preserve the maximum amount of information as it will not result in having to scrub any rows with unique \"Barcode\" values. In the real world, this is a kind of problem that I would address in the data pipeline/ingestion level."

    "To recap, each table had a handful of data quality issues that raised concerns for me about how this data was ingested and validated in its DBMS or equivalent data processing infrastructure. The Users table didn't have significant data quality issues with regard to its structural integrity (the \"ID\" field was already a valid key from the start), but the large proportion of records with missing \"Language\" data should be investigated. The Products table had a small number of duplicates with regard to its primary key \"Barcode\", and the Transactions table had a significant amount of duplicates with regard to its primary key \"Receipt ID\". Both of these are causes for concern and suggest that duplicate records are being entered into the system, and that the DBMS or equivalent data processing system is not configured to handle these cases. Another big issue not related to data integrity specifically but which is important is that the Products table has no field or collection of fields that definiitively communicate what the product is. This makes reporting on product-specific metrics intractable and may lead to some awkward meetings with non-technical audiences who are familiar with products only by their names. \n",

    "*Dear Manager,*\n",
    "\n",
    "*I have just completed some preliminary analysis of our database of users, products, and transactions. While I uncovered some important data quality issues in our database that will need to addressed, I find that some top brands among our users currently include candy and other snack brands, such as \"Dove\", \"Hershey's\", and \"Coca-Cola\".*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Of the data quality issues I mentioned, one of the biggest I found was that of duplicate records. Specifically, our products and transactions have rows with duplicate IDs. My guess is that multiple systems -- perhaps those that deal with user records and product records -- are both recording receipt scans into the database, resulting in repeat observations. This is something that will need to be fixed immediately to restore data integrity and also free up storage space. What can I do or to whom I should reach out to investigate this further?*\n",
    "\n",
    "*I was able to clean the data enough myself to do some simple analysis, and found that candy and other snack brands feature prominently in the top brands among certain users. Focusing on just users who are 21 years or older, the top 5 brands are \"Dove\", \"Nerds\", \"Coca-Cola\", \"Great Value\", and \"Hershey's\" in terms of the number of receipts scanned. One potential reason for this particular arrangement of brands is that they could be more likely to be purchased in frequent \"small basket\" grocery trips. Buying one snack or convenience store item is an easier, and more common way of generating and scanning receipts than getting large baskets of groceries. So it makes sense that snacks would be more likely to be recorded with receipt scans.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*My recommendation is to investigate this trend further. Once the previously mentioned data integrity issues are dealt with, we should do a further deep dive into this trend by investigating specific products rather than just brands. Unfortunately, our database doesn't record the name of the individual products scanned: only the categories, brands, and manufacturers. If we could bring in or begin collecting this data, it would be extremely valuable to us in the long-run. And, for this investigation in particular, it would allow us to ask 'Among the top brands, which products specifically are being purchased? Are they, generally speaking, bulk consumables or individual snacks?'.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*I look forward from hearing back from you and continuing this investigation.*\n",
